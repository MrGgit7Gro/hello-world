My name is Matthew, I'm originally from Fairfax, Virginia. I enjoy listening to all types of music, but my favorite is blues music. I play a few musical instruments, my favorite is guitar which I have played since I was 12. My wife, Alicyn, and I moved to Texas last year, we met in Utah where we both were going to college. She is currently studying to become a dental hygenist. We have an adorable one year old cat named Princess Zuzu. She is only just a little bit spoiled.
